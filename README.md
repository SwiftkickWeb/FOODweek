# FOODweek

## Elevator Pitch

Every week, I meal plan. Once a week, I sit down and pick out recipes for the next week whilst doing my food shopping on freshdirect. I may be checking what's on sale and googling for recipes. I may ask my wife or kids if they have they're in the mood for anything. I may just be sitting and wondering what haven't I made in a while. And in this process, Iâ€™m hopping between:

1. conversations with family
2. the grocery cart on fresh direct
3. googling recipes
4. a text file where I write out my meal plan

FOODweek is an online tool to help you do all that in one place. Well, most of it. It can't talk to your kids. That's on you.

# Purpose:

1. Store your favorite recipes
2. Use your stored recipes to create a weekly meal plan
3. Have your weekly meal plan generate a shopping list for you
4. Future: integrate with online grocery services to help you order your shopping list
